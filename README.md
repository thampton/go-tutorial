3 ways to initialize - (keyword var)
Implict initialization `:=` is most common
Local Variables must be used or results in compiler error
int, float32, float64, boolen, complex (real imag)

## Pointers
Location in memory that holds variable for usi
nil indicates a pointer not pointing to anything
* deferences pointers and indicates type is a pointer
No pointer arhitmetic 
& is the address of operator

## Constants
keyword const, can use implict type but must assign value
const blocks and iota allow for advanced constant patterns

Arrays - brackets go before size
